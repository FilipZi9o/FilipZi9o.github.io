                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Bank Ident is an identification method that works as follows: the users prove their identity by performing a single digit cent amount reference transfer through their own bank, logging in to their account through second factor. This, along with SCHUFA check, allows Verimi to verify the user's identity, which is then further confirmed through a digital signature (QES).</p>
                 <p>This is a method that could prove itself to be a strong option along our other ident methods. From the standpoint of the flow itself, the UI and the UX copy, there is still a lot to be done, as can be seen from this list of product requirements / feature requests by our partners, and our own assumptions on what is not optimal with the flow at the moment. That is why a usability test was conducted, to check if our assumptions were right, and as part of the discovery stage, to try to identify the user pain points and problems with the current flow, and possible opportunities that we didn’t consider.</p>

            <p>
                The goal of this usability test was to gather qualitative data that would help us find ways to improve the UI and overall experience of the Bank Ident
                flow in order to:   
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Decrease the cancel rate and drop-off (the biggest drop-off of 50% is at bank selection screen)</li>
                <li>Increase partner acceptance to 80% for interested partners</li>
                <li>Increase the overall conversion rate of this ident method i.e. the probability that the users finish the flow successfully</li>

                        <li>Usability issues were found with input fields, especially on smaller screens, resulting in missed error messages.</li>
                        <li>Navigation buttons were placed too closely, leading to errors during the usability test.</li>
                        <li>Several users experienced session timeouts, with no clear warnings provided.</li>

                <p>The usability test confirmed that several changes could significantly improve the Bank Ident experience. Participants' feedback has highlighted the need for improved UI elements, clearer navigation, and an overall streamlined user experience.</p>
