                <h3>Objective</h3>
                    <p>
                        The initial objective was to provide beautifully displayed and easy-to-understand wind, wave, weather, and algae reports, forecasts, and statistics for sailors, surfers, divers, and any other water sports aficionados. During the initial stages of the project, I decided to concentrate on the surfers only, to allow for a quicker and more effective design process.

                <h3>Challenges</h3>
                    <p>The main challenges of this project were:   
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Enable users to get <strong>the right information at the right time.</strong></li>
                        <li>Present <strong>complex information</strong> intuitively and cleanly.</li>
                        <li>Make the key features o the app <strong>as relevant as possible for surfers.</strong></li>
                        <li><strong>Interconnect key features</strong> in the best way possible, from a navigational and logical point of view.</li>
                        <li>Not fall victim to <strong>feature creep</strong> and try to squeeze in too many features (especially because I was a one-man team and had tight deadlines).</li>

                <img src="images/VelaTheProcess.jpg" alt="Bank Ident" class="illustration" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">
                    <p>This project was structured around the Design Thinking process and backed up by the User-Centered Design process. True to their iterative nature I went back and forth through the steps, making sure all the design decisions were based on research and analysis.

            <h3>Problem Statement and Solution</h3>
            <p>
                The first step was to define the problem to find a solution for it, and I came up with a problem statement:   
            </p>
            <p style="font-style: italic; font-family: Georgia, serif; background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 5px; border-radius: 4px;">
                Surfer users <strong>need a way</strong>  to check meteorological information in real-time and to be able to quickly and accurately assess complex weather conditions.   
            </p>
            <p>
            The identified <strong>solution</strong> is designing a weather report app that:   
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Is visually appealing and contains a well-organized User Interface.</li>
                <li>Makes checking the meteorological conditions a quick, effective, and delightful experience.</li>
                <li>Decreases the possibility of incorrectly interpreting the data on weather conditions, or being prone to not checking them, because of it being complicated and unintuitive.</li>
              </ul>

            <p>
                I didn‘t go for the obvious ones: the biggest and most popular, instead I went for two smaller players: <strong style="color: #0058AE;">Surfline</strong> and <strong style="color: #04257A;">Wisuki</strong>. Both are relatively new on the market and both have a task similar to my product's: <strong>new user acquisition</strong> and subsequently <strong>maintaining high engagement and retention rate</strong>. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The 2 competitors were analyzed by: 
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Marketing Profile</strong> (the way they present themselves on the market and attract customers)</li>
                <li><strong>Overall strategy</strong> ( their overall business strategy and position in respect to competitors)</li>
                <li><strong>UX Analysis</strong> (the features they offer and overall usability) </li>
                <li><strong>SWOT Analysis</strong></li>

        <h3>Business requirements</h3>
            <p>
                Now that the goals for measuring the performance of the product itself were set, it was time to set the business goals and objectives. The general target audience and competition were identified, as well as risks and opportunities. Also, all the goals and their KPIs were set in a time frame, to have fixed deadlines.

                    <p>
                        The observations, participants' quotes and Errors and Usability issues were all gathered on the Figjam board and clustered directly after the session, together with the assisting person and the product owner in those cases where he was present. We would go through the notes that we made and discuss them.

                        During this discussion sessions, we clustered all the relevant findings into common themes and issues using an Affinity Map. This helped us recognize and group the observations into 5 groups:

                        These observation points now grouped into common themes, were further put into a rainbow spreadsheet as a visual summmary and way to visually recognize patterns and see the severity of the problem or how common an observation is.

                <h3>Key Findings Summmary</h3>
                <div class="findings-list">
                    <p>Here are the key findings from the usability test, which show that most of our assumptions have been confirmed:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><h4><span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Moving the Bank Selection step to the front of the user flow would decrease user frustration and reduce cancellation rate by 50%.">Hypothesis 1</span> <span>&#9989;</span></h4>
                            <p>4 out of 5 participants had an account with a bank that was not supported by Bank Ident (because they performed the task in test environment
                                with testbank they could continue with the flow, but in real life they would be unable to proceed on the Bank-selection Screen) and all 5
                                expressed that they would prefer to have that screen at the begining so they don’t have to go through all the previous steps, invest so much
                                time and effort into filling in input fields and reading about the steps ahead (Ident-Form & PIS-Intro screens) and then still be unable to finish
                                the flow.</p></li>
                        <li><h4><span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Introducing a progress bar would increase the user's sense of control and lead to an improved conversion rate.">Hypothesis 2</span> <span>&#9989;</span></h4>
                            <p>3 out of 5 participants Expressed a wish for some kind of progress indicator or progress bar, to be able to anticipate how many steps are
                                ahead, to make them feel more comfortable and give them a feeling of control over the process, and make it more transparent. The remaining
                                2 participants were on one side an extremely tech savvy product manager, that very quickly finished the task, and had some background
                                knowledge of the process, and therefore didn’t feel the need for a progress bar, and on the other a 60+ retired teacher, that wasn’t interested
                                in the process, and how many steps it consists off, but her initial trust that she put into the process was insurance enough that she could trust
                                it, and not worry how many steps it takes.</p></li>
                        <li><h4><span class="tooltip" data-tooltip="Reducing the number of steps would improve conversion rates.">Hypothesis 3</span><span>&#10067;</span></h4>
                            <p>3 out of 5 participants didn’t read the text on the PIS-intro screen, and found the screen to be unnecessary, but the other 2 found it to be
                                helpful. All the participants found that all the steps of the flow were necessary, and as the result, judging from the qualitative data and the
                                perception of the test participants, this hypthesis has not been completely confirmed. What the UT showed is that the sense of orientation and
                                control of the process i.e. knowing how many steps are left and having transparent information on what happens at each step is far more
                                important for conversion.</p></li>

                                    <p>A number of usability, UI, and UX issues were identified, including:</p>
                                    <ol>
                                        <li>Input Field Usability:
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>Date of Birth input field on the Ident-Form screen, and bank selection input on the Bank-Selection screen, were noted as problematic.</li>
                                                <li>On smaller screens, if users fail to check the title radio button or make an error, the input field may not be visible, causing confusion when the "Next" button doesn’t respond.</li>
                                            </ul>
                                        </li>
                                        <li>Button Placement:
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>The "Next" and "Back" buttons are too close and vertically aligned, leading to frequent misclicks. Three out of five participants clicked "Back" instead of "Next."</li>

                                                <li>Sessions timed out for four out of five participants, likely due to lengthy interaction with each screen. Adding a timeout warning or countdown could mitigate this issue.</li>

                                                <li>Less tech-savvy users overlooked the toggle option, finding it irrelevant whether they received the document locally or not.</li>
