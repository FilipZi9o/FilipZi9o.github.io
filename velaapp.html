<h3 class="fade-in">Objective</h3>
<p class="fade-in">
                        The initial objective was to provide beautifully displayed and easy-to-understand wind, wave, weather, and algae reports, forecasts, and statistics for sailors, surfers, divers, and any other water sports aficionados. During the initial stages of the project, I decided to concentrate on the surfers only, to allow for a quicker and more effective design process.

<ul class="fade-in">
<li>Enable users to get <strong>the right information at the right time.</strong></li>
<li>Present <strong>complex information</strong> intuitively and cleanly.</li>
<li>Make the key features o the app <strong>as relevant as possible for surfers.</strong></li>
<li><strong>Interconnect key features</strong> in the best way possible, from a navigational and logical point of view.</li>
<li>Not fall victim to <strong>feature creep</strong> and try to squeeze in too many features (especially because I was a one-man team and had tight deadlines).</li>

<h3 class="fade-in">Problem Statement and Solution</h3>

                The first step was to define the problem to find a solution for it, and I came up with a problem statement:   
            </p>
<p class="fade-in" style="font-style: italic; font-family: Georgia, serif; background-color: #f0f0f0; padding: 5px; border-radius: 4px;">
                Surfer users <strong>need a way</strong>  to check meteorological information in real-time and to be able to quickly and accurately assess complex weather conditions.   
            </p>
<p class="fade-in">
            The identified <strong>solution</strong> is designing a weather report app that:   
            </p>
<ul>
<li>Is visually appealing and contains a well-organized User Interface.</li>
<li>Makes checking the meteorological conditions a quick, effective, and delightful experience.</li>
<li>Decreases the possibility of incorrectly interpreting the data on weather conditions, or being prone to not checking them, because of it being complicated and unintuitive.</li>

                            To better understand and organize all the information gathered during interviews, and analyze it, I made use of <strong>Affinity Mapping</strong>.<br/> This method helped me come up with a list of key insights, that helped me decide upon what aspects and features of the app I am going to concentrate on in my project.

<div class="content-container">
<h3 class="fade-in">Key Insights:</h3>
<ol class="fade-in">
<li>The surfers living near surfing spots <strong>tend not to go on long-distance surfing trips</strong> as often as surfers that don't have any surfing spots near the place they live.</li>
<li>The<strong> more experienced surfers</strong> are, the more particular they are about the conditions they are looking for and interested in its details.</li>
<li>The <strong>weather forecast is not particularly important</strong> to surfers, and <strong>algae reports have absolutely no relevance</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>Finding new spots</strong> is very important to surfers, regardless of their level of experience, but the more experienced they are, the more secretive they are about unknown and uncrowded surfing spots.</li>
<li>There are <strong>two types of notifications</strong> relevant to surfers:
                            <ul>
<li>Notifications about a very particular combination of conditions depend on the surfer's personal preference and require a high level of detail manipulating notifications settings.</li>
<li>Warnings and alarms, for example in case of the presence of sharks or jellyfish at the surfing spot.</li>

<h3 class="fade-in">Personas</h3>
<p class="fade-in">Based on the data gathered through interviews and later analyzed, I set up two personas. They represented two major categories of users that we identified: <strong>beginner surfers</strong> and <strong>expert surfers</strong>. The two personas are 100% based on the interviewed participants in all their aspects relevant to the app. <br/>The personas would help me to recognize what features I should concentrate on, and how the features would best resolve any need or problem a potential user might have. <br/>I referred to them later on throughout the entire product development process.

<div class="content-container">
<h3 class="fade-in">User Flows</h3>
<p class="fade-in">Now that the potential users were defined and had a solid enough shape, the moment came to work on ideas about how they would interact with the app. Although it was already clear by this time that the app would be relatively complex, with plenty of options available to the users, I wanted the user flows to stay simple and straightforward. This would keep the features that I would work on later in form of prototypes from becoming unnecessarily complicated.   
            </p>

<div class="content-container">
<h3 class="fade-in">Sitemap</h3>
<p class="fade-in">The sitemap that resulted was somewhat complicated. The app itself has a complex information architecture because everything is so intertwined and connected, with child pages from different parents connected between themselves horizontally and between different levels in the hierarchy. But that is the nature of the app, and I wanted to allow the users to quickly access relevant screens that are not necessarily related to each other.

<h3 class="fade-in">Card Sorting</h3>
</div>
<div class="content-container flex-container" style="display: flex; align-items: flex-start; flex-wrap: wrap;">
<div class="text-content" style="flex: 1; padding-right: 20px;">
<p class="fade-in">
                        To see if the sitemap I came up with would be intuitive and intelligible enough with potential users, I performed a <strong>closed card sorting</strong>. It was closed because the main categories were already quite clear and decided upon, and the only thing I wanted to find out was how the users would organize items, and see if their <strong>mental models</strong> would be aligned with the sitemap.  
                    </p>
<p class="fade-in">The card sorting was performed online on <strong>OptimalSort</strong> with 12 participants. </p>
</div>
<div class="image-content" style="flex: 1;">

</div>
<div class="text-content" style="flex: 1;">
<p class="fade-in">
                        The results showed that the sitemap was pretty intuitive, and there were only two discrepancies:
                    </p>
<ol>
<li>"Add Private Spot" card, which 9 out of 12 participants have placed in the "User Profile" category, and in the sitemap, it was under the "Search Spots" category.</li>
<li>"Member Profile" is in the "Community" category in our sitemap, and all 12 participants have placed it in the "User Profile" category. Here it was obviously a matter of not labeling the card well enough, because from the name of the card it is not clear that it is about members, and not the user him/herself.</li>
</ol>
<p class="fade-in">
                        Consequently the structure of the sitemap remained the same, only the labeling of the features changed, but minimally.

<h3 class="fade-in">Hand-Drawn Sketches</h3>
<p class="fade-in">
                        To start off the prototyping phase of the project, I sketched wireframes for the navigation, both on mobile and desktop view, based on the sitemap. I began with the navigation so that I could start painting the app with the widest possible brush strokes, and have a base off of which I would develop the rest of the wireframes, and continue improving them.

</div>
</div>
<div class="content-container">
<p class="fade-in">After that I decided to sketch a couple of main features that I would work on throughout this project:</p>
<ol>
<li><h4 class="fade-in">Search surfing spots</h4>
<p class="fade-in">It was based on the same feature in one of the analyzed competitors but also heavily influenced by google maps, having similar functionality and design patterns. The users can find a surfing spot both by searching on the map and tapping on the pinpoint representing it or by typing its name in the search box.</p></li>

<p class="fade-in">
                        The animation shows the "Secret Spot" feature. The first iteration of it was based on a similar feature found in one of the analyzed competitors. Tapping on the FAB button opens a pop-up and a pin appears centered on the screen. The users swipe the map underneath, getting dynamically the location underneath the pin on the pop-up. When the users find the right location, pressing the CTA brings them to the Add Secret Spot Screen, where they can give the spot a custom name and add info about it. Clicking on the CTA takes them to the newly created surfing spot screen.

                        To reduce the cognitive load, using the principle of progressive disclosure, the advanced settings are hidden by default. The users can twirl them open if they want to access those. Translated to user personas, the assumption was that this would be valuable to the more experienced surfers, while the beginners would probably only use the basic settings. I would be sure about that only after performing usability testing though.

<h4 class="fade-in">1. Find Secret Spot Functionality too confusing for the Users</h4>
<p class="fade-in">
                        Finding and saving secret surfing spots is one of the core features of the app, but it posed quite a problem for all the participants.  
                    </p>
<p class="fade-in">Severity: High</p>
<p class="fade-in">
                        Evidence: 4 participants found the feature's functionality and flow to be confusing and not intuitive, one participant was unable to initiate the task alone, couldn't recognize the FAB button, and needed help, 3 participants were unable to perform the task without suggestions and 1 participant expressed the wish to find the location typing in the name or coordinates, and not only by moving the pinpoint on the map.  
                    </p>
<p class="fade-in">
                        Solution: Completely change the functionality of the feature, going for something the users would be more familiar with. Since most users are familiar with Google Maps, we decided to use the mental model already created by it for this feature, and try to replicate the functionality found there. We decided to get rid of the FAB button, and let the user tap and hold to open a modal with info about the location, and the possibility to save the location as a secret spot. It is also possible to come to the same result by typing the name of the location in the search box.

<p class="fade-in">
                        The results showed that the sitemap was pretty intuitive, and there were only two discrepancies:Here everything proved to be working fine, except the fact that the participants were looking for the save button, which I overlooked, thinking that after adjusting the settings the users would just press the back arrow to go back to the map view.
                    </p>
<p class="fade-in">
                        Severity: Medium

<p class="fade-in">
                        Evidence: 5 participants were trying to find the save button after adjusting the filter settings and couldn't find it, and were not sure how to go back to the map view with the settings saved.
                    </p>
<p class="fade-in">
                        Solution: I added the "Save Settings" button at the bottom of the screen.

<p class="fade-in">Severity: High</p>
<p class="fade-in">
                            Evidence: 5 participants were perplexed by this problem and although it was not explicitly part of any of the tasks, they asked what the favorites are, and how to save spots to favorites.  
                        </p>
<p class="fade-in">
                            Solution: After consulting competitors to see how this problem was dealt with, I chose a heart icon next to the spot name to be the best solution for this problem.

                            Saving Secret Spots that are only visible to the user that saved them, and get a forecast for them, is another of the core features of the app. Although we elaborated a way to search and save them, there was no way of finding these spots later.

<p class="fade-in">
                            Solution: I found that the folder with a list of secret spots should be inside of the user category, and we placed it in the first tab of the user screen, directly under the surfing history list.

</div>
<div class="content-container">
<p class="fade-in">After adjusting the prototype a less official and extensive round of usability testing was performed on it, along with peer review, where I got some valuable input from my course's colleagues, and both my tutor and mentor. This resulted in a couple of new iterations with improved usabilty. Parallely, I started polishing the UI, aiming for an overall consistency both in terms of visual design and design patterns. This involved for example devising a grid for the screens and developing a color scheme. The result was a Styleguide for my app.

<h4 class="fade-in">Grid</h4>
<p class="fade-in">
                        On the example of the Surfing Spot screen, we can see how introducing a grid to our screens has improved the organization of the content and elements of the screen layouts. The grid helped us to align all the entries to the left, touching the margin. The heart icon that serves to save the spot to favorites has been centered inside the fifth columns, and the arrow back is also aligned left to the margin. the tabs are maybe not obviously aligned to the grid, but the grid helped us find the middle of the screen, to find where the tab line is ending. We also aligned the spot's name to the left on the second column.

<div class="content-container">
<h4 class="fade-in">Color Scheme</h4>
<p class="fade-in">The color scheme also through several iterations until I came to the final solution. I was very aware of the importance and various implication of the color choices, and of the fact that they not only visually represent the app's identity, but are also very efficient from the point of view of the emotional and subconscious effect they have ( visceral level).

<h2 class="fade-in">Conclusion</h2>
<p class="fade-in">Plans for the future would be doing a couple of more iterations and subsequent Usability tests, and only go into the development phase when I am sure that any major technical debt would be avoided. This might last for another 2 months. I also have to be careful not to allow for feature creep, and not go too wild trying to improve the product, so both time limits and technical limits of what is possible are met.</p>
