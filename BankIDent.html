                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>Verimi is a German digital identity platform that provides secure online authentication, identity verification, and payment services for businesses and individuals across various industries.</p>
                <p><a href="https://verimi.de/en/verimi-bank-ident/" style="color: #005252; font-weight: bold; text-decoration: none;" target="_blank">Bank-Ident</a> is one of the identity verification method that they offer, and at the time the Usability Testing was conducted, it was introduced and deployed only for a very small number of partners, and was still in an early stage.
                    It showed a lot of potential and several advantages like for example:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>It is fully automated and requires no need for physical ID documents or agents to carry out the identification</li>
                        <li>It is MLA-, eIDAS- and  KYC-compliant</li>
                        <li>It includes a qualified electronic signature (QES), so it can also be used for digitaly signing legal documents</li>
                        <li>It insures that the IBAN provided really belongs to the customer, and so can protect against fraud in e-commerce</li>
                    </ul>   
                <p>Although very practical and convenient in theory, it has proven to be quite the opposite in practice, indicated not only by a long list of product requirements / feature requests by the partners that introduced it, but also just going once throught the flow it was obvious to everyone in the product team that it was too long and there was plenty of room for improvement.</p>
                <p class="fade-in">Being the product designer in charge of UX research I had a couple of initial meetings with the product owner of this feature, because it was obvious that there was a need for a usability test, to check if our own assumptions about the flow were right, try to identify as many pain points the users might have, and possible opportunities that we didn't consider.  I planned, conducted the usability testing, and finally analysed and presented the findings to relevant stakeholders. </p>

            <p class="fade-in">
                The usability test was carried out at the Verimi headquarters, in a small conference room that was turned into a usability lab.<br>The sessions took place between 04.05.2022 - 12.05.2022 with 5 test participants from a user testing pool that we as a product design team established. Each session lasted around 45 minutes, with one scenario task that the participants had to complete. <br>
                We recruited participants as varied in terms of age, tech savviness and gender as possible.
                <br>I moderated the sessions assisted by my product designer colleague, and at 3 sessions the product owner was also present.<br> We decided not to use a Figma prototype for the testing, but have the participants complete their scenario task in the UAT environment, where they could interact with the actual version of this feature. <br>The sessions were not recorded, but the observations and remarks were written on post it notes on the dedicated Figjam board by myself and the assisting person.

                            <p class="fade-in">4 out of 5 participants had an account with a bank that was not supported by Bank Ident (because they performed the task in test environment
                                with testbank they could continue with the flow, but in real life they would be unable to proceed on the Bank-selection Screen) and all 5
                                expressed that they would prefer to have that screen at the begining so they don’t have to go through all the previous steps, invest so much
                                time and effort into filling in input fields and reading about the steps ahead (Ident-Form & PIS-Intro screens) and then still be unable to finish
                                the flow.</p></li>

                            <p class="fade-in">3 out of 5 participants Expressed a wish for some kind of progress indicator or progress bar, to be able to anticipate how many steps are
                                ahead, to make them feel more comfortable and give them a feeling of control over the process, and make it more transparent. The remaining
                                2 participants were on one side an extremely tech savvy product manager, that very quickly finished the task, and had some background
                                knowledge of the process, and therefore didn’t feel the need for a progress bar, and on the other a 60+ retired teacher, that wasn’t interested
                                in the process, and how many steps it consists off, but her initial trust that she put into the process was insurance enough that she could trust
                                it, and not worry how many steps it takes.</p></li>

                                helpful. All the participants found that all the steps of the flow were necessary, and as the result, judging from the qualitative data and the
                                perception of the test participants, this hypthesis has not been completely confirmed. What the UT showed is that the sense of orientation and
                                control of the process i.e. knowing how many steps are left and having transparent information on what happens at each step is far more
